              Take the
              <Link to="/"> provided HTML page ,</Link>
              use
              <strong>React</strong>
              and get the JSON data from the provided API.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use the data to create a `ticker` element that shows matches that
              are currently being played.
            </li>
            <li>
              It should show one match at a time and use a carousel type sliding
              animation to switch between them.
            </li>
            <li>
              The end result should be as close to the provided design as
              possible.

            <h3>Detailed requirements</h3>

                Every match should be shown for
                <strong>3 seconds.</strong>
              </li>
              <li>
                After this it should switch to a new match using a `carousel`
                style animation where the current match slides out left and the
                new match slides in.
              </li>

                The duration of the slide animation should be
                <strong>500 ms</strong>
              </li>
              <li>
                Each match should show:

                  <li>
                    The date and time when match starts/started. If the match is
                    playing today it should say
                    <strong>`Today`,</strong>
                    otherwise it should show the date in
                    <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>
                    format.

                    A button style link that opens the match in the Unibet
                    Betting Client. The format of the link should be
                    <code>https://www.unibet.com/betting#/event/live/1234</code>
                    , where `1234` is replaced with the correct Event ID for the

              </li>
              <li>
                The data fetched from the API should be
                <strong>cached for 2 minutes.</strong>
                Meaning that no additional API calls should be made during this
                time, even when the page is reloaded.

            <li>
              The API URL to use is:
              <code>

              </code>
              .
